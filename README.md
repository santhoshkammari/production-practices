## Example POC:
# Multihop QA POC Plan

## Week 1: Problem Definition & Literature Review

### Day 1-2: Problem Definition
- Define specific multihop QA task and dataset
- Set measurable goals (e.g., accuracy, speed, complexity of questions)
- Identify key stakeholders and their expectations

### Day 3-5: Literature Review
- Review papers: 
  1. "Multi-hop Reading Comprehension through Question Decomposition and Rescoring" (Min et al., 2019)
  2. "Answering Complex Open-domain Questions Through Iterative Query Refinement" (Qi et al., 2019)
  3. "Neural Module Networks for Reasoning over Text" (Gupta et al., 2020)
- Analyze GitHub repos:
  1. https://github.com/facebookresearch/multihop_dense_retrieval
  2. https://github.com/AkariAsai/learning_to_retrieve_reasoning_paths

## Week 2-3: Rapid Prototyping & Integration

### Day 1-3: Setup & Baseline
- Set up development environment with PyTorch and Transformers
- Implement baseline using HuggingFace's pipeline for QA
- Integrate with LangChain for basic document retrieval

### Day 4-7: Component Implementation
- Implement question decomposition (inspired by Min et al., 2019)
- Develop iterative refinement module (based on Qi et al., 2019)
- Create reasoning module using LangChain's agents

### Day 8-10: Integration
- Combine components into a cohesive pipeline using LangChain
- Implement data loading and preprocessing for your specific dataset
- Set up evaluation metrics (e.g., F1 score, Exact Match)

## Week 4: Testing & Refinement

### Day 1-2: Initial Testing
- Run full pipeline on test set
- Analyze results and identify bottlenecks

### Day 3: Stakeholder Demo
- Present initial results to stakeholders
- Gather feedback on performance and desired improvements

### Day 4-5: Refinement
- Implement stakeholder feedback
- Optimize slow components (e.g., caching, parallel processing)

## Week 5: Final Iteration & Presentation

### Day 1-3: Final Testing & Optimization
- Conduct comprehensive testing on various question types
- Fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance
- Implement any final optimizations

### Day 4-5: Documentation & Presentation Prep
- Document system architecture and key decisions
- Prepare final presentation and live demo
- Compile list of future improvements and research directions

### Day 5: Final Presentation
- Present final POC to stakeholders
- Demonstrate live examples
- Discuss potential applications and next steps
